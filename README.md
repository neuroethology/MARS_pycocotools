This fork of pycocotools from the COCO API was made to allow evaluation of mouse pose estimates that use the MARS keypoint definitions:

The code is largely unchanged, however the sigmas used for Object Keypoint Similarity have been modified to reflect the values estimated from the MARS dataset; this change was made in pycocotools/cocoeval.py. The Matlab and Lua versions of the original CoCo API have been removed for simplicity.
